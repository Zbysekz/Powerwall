# Powerwall

Repository for my DIY Powerwall system.
Using 18650 li-ion battery and DIY BMS system combined with raspberryPi3.
BMS cell module is taken and modified from Stuart Pittaway (https://github.com/stuartpittaway/diyBMS)

I am from Czech republic, so used electronic parts are picked as cheap as possible within EU region.

Schematics and PCB layouts are on EasyEDA (online free tool) https://easyeda.com/zbysekzapadlik/battery-management-system

Block diagram can be found in docs folder.
